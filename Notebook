Heuristic:
Best so far :
Slightly better than snp (~10%) , not good and stable enough
buy:
- Long Trend is upwards/ not going down:
    - the slop of ma_150 is positive
- Not too much fluctuations - limit the effect of delayed trade commands:
     - threshold on zero crossing of bandpass 20-50
-  ma20 is crossing ma50 upward
sell :
-  ma20 is crossing ma50 downward



Failed Tests:
Heuristics :
    - most of the logic in the original charnybot  does not contribute or losses money
    - Relaying on distance/ratio to a single ma (ma50 for example) as a buy/sell timing does
        not work well, In many cases the stock price is not "related" to this ma .
Indicators :
  RSI :
     - does not work as primary indicator
     - Did not work as a secondary clue :
        - Dont buy if  overbought
            could not find ANY threshold that improved
        - Timing of buying / selling
            delay the sell / buy decision guided by  RSI
  MACD :
       bad results as primary  indicator
  Support level :
       - Adding stop loss a bit below the nearest support level - failed

  MA crossing :
       - As a single indicator - does  not give good results
       - Tried several ma periods / types 20-50 looks best , not by much
